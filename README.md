# Jimmy The Hipochondriac

**-Made in 48h for Student Gamejam X-**


Jimmy is hypochondriac; he's affraid of getting infected by viruses or other things. He needs to buy some soap to remain clean and calm. Will he arrive to the shop without dying of disgust?

**Created by:** Alberto "Big Boss", Ruben "Immortan", JanSau "EldanForrester", Victor "Filoctetes", Borja "Totespare" & Varo "miroky".

>*We have taken a few things and assets from other videogames such as Scribblenauts or Metal Gear Solid to create some of the enviroment of the game. We've used free music from the Internet and Nuclear by Mike Oldfield. The rest of the game is entirely made by us.
